# Task-3
Door lock system Challenge – Task One (Day 3)

1. Write a python program that simulates a door lock system such that:

 Password is set and stored in a variable,
 Commands to instruct the door are stored in variables.
 When a user enters the wrong password an error message is displayed and prompted to
enter the password again.
 When a user enters “open” a “The door is now open” statement is displayed, when the
“open” is entered more than once, a message is displayed saying, “the door is already
open”
 When a user enters “close” a “The door is now locked” statement is displayed, when the
“open” is entered more than once, a message is displayed saying, “the door is already
locked”
 When a user enters “quit” the process is terminated and the message is displayed.
 When a wrong message is entered or an invalid key is pressed a “Invalid input” message is
displayed.
 When the door is locked or open, it prints out the last date/time the door was opened, eg
“Door Last open at 2022-07-05 08:46:20.535395”
